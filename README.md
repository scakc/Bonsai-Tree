# Bonsai-Tree


Its a recent research by Microsoft Research India on non linear decision tree based method for classification purpose. It achieves high accuracy with less size for resource constraint devices. I am reproducing the code with a bit of simplification.

Modified the curretn bonsai model to include convolutional layers which further decreases the model size increases CNNs explainability and increamental learning can be done.
